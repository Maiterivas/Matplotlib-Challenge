## Data/Result Observations

* Observation 1: In multiple instances, I saw that the drugs Capomulin and Ramicane stood out compared to the other drug regimens. It seems that they had a far larger efficacy than the rest of the drugs, which is evident in the boxplot chart, where the tumor volumes for both Capomulin and Ramicane are far lower than the rest of the treatments.

* Observation 2: The results of the drug regimen efficacy show that most drugs tend to stay within the same range of tumor volumes, at around the 50 to 70 range. There is also only one outlier in the whole dataset, for a mouse in the Infubinol regimen. This tells us that the results of the data is pretty accurate for what was provided. 

* Observation 3: The correlation value between the average tumor volume and weight of Capomulin mice, which is one of the more efficient regimens, is at 0.84. This value was very close to 1, implying a positive correlation between the average tumor volume and weight of Capomulin mice. This means that, theoretically, maybe higher weight is related to larger tumor sizes, or that lower weight is usually related to smaller tumor sizes.
